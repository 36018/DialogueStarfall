  dialogue:
  - As you open the door of the shop, you hear a bell ring.
  - 'You look around and see someone standing behind the counter.

'
  - 'You hear a loud buzzing noise coming from the corner, you look over and see
    a broken vending machine.

'
  - Welcome!
  - You look over to the person speaking. You see a tall figure behind the counter.
  - "Name\u2019s Reebo. \t"
  - "Keeper of shelves and finder of things. You\u2019re new here aren\u2019t you?."
  - 'Yeah.. What is this shop, what do you sell here? '
  - "Hard to say. It\u2019s a shop, sure-but not just a shop. This place finds lost
    things and we keep them here..."
  - The vending machine in the corner makes a loud banging noise. Something falls
    out of the vending machine and drops on the floor.
